## My Nixos base configuration

One gimmick is to link the corresponding config from machines folder as `special.nix`.
But since it now [can read /proc files](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/3546), I should handle this better, sometime..

Anyway I kept some references (greppable as "@Reference") which you might find interesting.
